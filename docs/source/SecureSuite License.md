----------

A SecureSuite License is required for CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard v3.0.0+ (due to release in December 2022). If a valid license is not present, some Dashboard features such as remote configuration assessment will not properly function.

**Steps to Download Your SecureSuite License**

1. Login to [CIS WorkBench](https://workbench.cisecurity.org/dashboard)
2. In the top right, click on your login name
3. Click on your Organization Name
4. Select the “Licenses” tab beneath your organization name on the left side of the screen
5. Click on Download
	- NOTE: Ensue that JavaScript is unblocked on your browser if you do not see that the file has downloaded.
6. Navigate to the downloaded files and extract/unzip the contents
7. Open the folder where the extracted files were stored, and copy the file `license.xml` to the host of CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard
	- During the installation process, you'll be prompted to select the license file

Your CIS SecureSuite license only changes if the terms of your Membership have recently changed. There is no need to input a new license on each install unless you are certain your terms have changed. The license enables the remote assessment features, default functionality as of Dashboard v3.0.0. Our SLTT Members should only need to input the license once on initial installation.

# CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard Deployment Guide #

----------
## Introduction ##
CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard is a web application built using the Grails Framework.  The grails framework uses a hibernate data model to remain DBMS agnostic.  Grails code compiles into java byte code and therefore runs on the JVM.  As such,  CIS-CAT Pro dashboard can be deployed in any RDBMS which supports JDBC, and on any web container that can handle java WAR's.  The documentation below describes how to deploy CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard on the following stack, which is officially supported by CIS:  MySQL 5.6 running on Ubuntu 16.04, a separate Ubuntu 16.04 server for Tomcat 8 and Apache 2.  Prerequisite to using this documentation is having two separate Ubuntu 16.04 instances running in your environment.

**Reiteration:**  Although this document is written assuming a MySQL database, Ubuntu servers, Tomcat and Apache HTTP Server, they are not required.  The Hibernate data model ensures a database-agnostic environment, so any relational database management system can be used (MySQL, Oracle, MS SQLServer, etc.).  Further, any operating system can host the application server, which can also utilize any software capable of hosting a java web application archive (.war file).

## System Recommendations ##
 There are no strict requirements associated with our Dashboard application. Any OS will be suitable so long as it can run Tomcat. Disk space will be minimal on the application server, but will require more space on your database server depending upon the size of your organization and the amount of endpoints you have.

Our test environment uses an AWS t2.large instance (designed for burst processing), which has:

 - 8GB RAM
 - 2 vCPUâ€™s with 4 cores each
 - Ubuntu 16.04
 
The application is fairly lightweight on processor and memory use. However, when importing results, the usage will spike. Our recommendation would be to conduct importing off hours and then the functionality of the application will not be hindered during business hours.

## Component Deployment ##
The following sections describe the installation and configuration of all components necessary to deploy CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard.

### Database ###
Install MySQL Server 5.6 onto the database Ubuntu server using [these instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-16-04).  
Once the MySQL database has been installed, note the following information:

- hostname/IP of database server
- port for connecting, by default this is `3306`
- username/password for connecting to the database

### Application Server ###
On a separate server from the database server, install Ubuntu 16.04 (or any operating system supported in the member's environment).  It is important that the database server be separated from the application server for security reasons.  The application server needs to be accessible over the network so that users can access the application, but if the application database were on the same server, it could also be exposed.  By having a separate server, the database can be configured to only communicate over the network via the MySQL port, and therefore be more secure.  Secondly, this configuration is more scalable.  Members can add application servers to the environment as load increases and have the applications communicate with the same database server.
Once Ubuntu 16.04 is installed, and a user can log in, run: sudo apt-get update, this will download the latest package lists from the known repositories so we can install some more software. 

### MySQL Client ###
A MySQL client should be installed in order to test connectivity with the database and create the schema for CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard.

run: `sudo apt-get install mysql-client`

This will give you access to the mysql command.
From the MySQL database instructions above, note the hostname/ip of the database server as `<hostname>`, and the configured `<username>` and `<password>`
run: `mysql -h <hostname> -u <username> -p`, you will then be prompted for the `<password>`.  If you see a `mysql>` prompt, then you have successfully connected to the database.
 
run: `create schema ccpd;`

This will create a DB schema named `ccpd` for CIS-CAT Dashboard Pro data.

At this point we recommend running following the steps in:
[CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard Database Script](http://cis-cat-pro-dashboard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/CIS-CAT%20Pro%20Dashboard%20Database%20Script/)

This will bootstrap in some reference data as well as the current versions of the CIS Benchmark content.  Having this data available via the script will improve initial import performance from CIS-CAT Pro Assessor.

### Java 8 ###
Because CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard is a java-based application, members will need to ensure that java is installed.

	# Install a JDK/JRE
	sudo apt-get install default-jdk
	
	# Ensure Java is installed at the proper version level (or higher)
	java -version

Ensure that the Java version is displayed as `1.8.0_111` (or higher)

### Application Server ###
Install Apache Tomcat 8 by following [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-apache-tomcat-8-on-ubuntu-16-04), through the end of Step 6.

**NOTE:** the tomcat version in the article is no longer available,  you will have to use this link to download in the curl command: [tomcat 8.5.12](http://apache.mirrors.ionfish.org/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.12/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.12.tar.gz)

Open `/opt/tomcat/conf/server.xml` and find this line:

    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           connectionTimeout="20000"
           redirectPort="8443"/>

and add the maxPostSize attribute:

    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           connectionTimeout="20000"
           redirectPort="8443"
           maxPostSize="25728640"/>

This will increase the max allowable file size for upload.  Many CIS-CAT Pro Assessor ARF reports will be larger than the default size.

Open `/opt/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh` and add the following lines to the top of the file, which will add some environment variables that CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard requires to run.

    export CCPD_CONFIG_FILE="/opt/tomcat/ccpd-config.yml"
    export CCPD_LOG_DIR="/opt/tomcat/logs"

**Note:**  The values of these environment variables can be configured to any location the administrator wishes, and must be to file system locations to which the Tomcat application server can access on startup.

#### Security Considerations ####
As a final step we want to remove the default applications available from the Tomcat install, including the examples and management applications.  These default sites can and will give away information about the environment and present an information security risk.

	# Navigate to the Tomcat applications directory
	cd /opt/tomcat/webapps
	
	# Remove the default applications
	sudo rm -R *  

This will remove all the default applications from the tomcat installation to help reduce the attack surface of the application server.

### Deploy WAR ###
At this point, it is prudent to deploy the CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard application (the "war") included in the downloadable bundle.  The initial deployment of the web application can then be tested via direct connection to the application server on port `8080`, without the web server.  This can help identify any application or application server misconfigurations prior to web server installation/configuration.


The permissions on these files need to allow the tomcat user to read/write.  The user who will be managing the Legacy imports will need write access to the Legacy folder.

Create the CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard runtime configuration file: `/opt/tomcat/ccpd-config.yml`, including the following lines:

	environments:
	    production:
	        grails:
	                serverURL: 'http://<url_of_apache_or_tomcat>:8080/CCPD' #if apache is not set up, only tomcat
	                #serverURL: 'http://<url_of_apache_or_tomcat>/CCPD' #if apache is set up use
	                #serverURL: 'https://<url_of_apache_or_tomcat>/CCPD' #if HTTPS is set up use
	        server:
	            'contextPath': '/CCPD'
	        dataSource:
	            dbCreate: update
	
	            #MySQL DB Settings

	            # url: jdbc:sqlserver://<path_to_mysql_database_server>:1433;databaseName=<schema_name_of_database>
	            # username: <db_user>
	            # password: <db_password>
	
	            #Oracle DB Settings
	
	            # driverClassName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
	            # dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10Dialect
	            # url: jdbc:oracle:thin:@<path_to_mysql_database_server>:1521:<schema_name_of_database>

	                  initialSize: 5
	                  maxActive: 50
	                  minIdle: 5
	                  maxIdle: 25
	                  maxWait: 10000

	                  validationInterval: 15000
	                  dbProperties:
	                        autoReconnect: true
	
	grails:
	    mail:
	        host: <smtp server host name>
	        port: 465
	        username: <username>
	        password: <password>
	        props:
	            mail.transport.protocol: "smtps"
	            mail.smtp.port: "465"
	            mail.smtp.auth: "true"
	            mail.smtp.starttls.enable: "true"
	            mail.smtp.starttls.required: "true"
	
	database: MySQL
	#database: SQLServer
	#database: Oracle


This file is also available in the CIS-CAT-Pro-Dashboard bundle, you will just need to replace the pertinent information, marked with <>, with the specifics of your environment.


**NOTE: MySQL Timezone setting** It is important for the timezone on the application server and the database server to be the same.  If this is not the case in your environment you can set the timezone of the database connection using a jdbc option:

	jdbc:mysql://<path_to_mysql_database_server>:3306/<schema_name_of_mysql_database>?useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&serverTimezone=<3-letter-timezone>

### Database Configuration ###
By default the ccpd-config.yml is configured to utilize a MySQL database.  Starting with version v1.0.3 you will be able to use MS SQL Server and Oracle Databases as well.  In the ccpd-config.yml, there are several settings you need to make to utilize these other DBMS:


**SQL Server**

You will need to comment out the MySQL configuration and uncomment the SQL Server Section:

	#MySQL DB Settings
	
    # driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    # dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
    # url: jdbc:mysql://<path_to_mysql_database_server>:3306/<schema_name_of_mysql_database>
    # username: <db_user>
    # password: <db_password>

    #SQL Server DB Setting

    driverClassName: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
    dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.SQLServer2008Dialect
    url: jdbc:sqlserver://<path_to_mysql_database_server>:1433;databaseName=<schema_name_of_database>
    username: <db_user>
    password: <db_password>

Then enter the connection information appropriate to your SQL Server database.

At the very bottom of the file comment out the database entry for MySQL and uncomment the entry for SQL Server:

	#database: MySQL
	database: SQLServer
	#database: Oracle


**Oracle**

You will need to comment out the MySQL configuration and uncomment the SQL Server Section:

	#MySQL DB Settings
	
    # driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    # dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
    # url: jdbc:mysql://<path_to_mysql_database_server>:3306/<schema_name_of_mysql_database>
    # username: <db_user>
    # password: <db_password>

    #Oracle DB Settings
	
    driverClassName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
    dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10Dialect
    url: jdbc:oracle:thin:@<path_to_mysql_database_server>:1521:<schema_name_of_database>
    username: <db_user>
    password: <db_password>

Then enter the connection information appropriate to your Oracle database.


At the very bottom of the file comment out the database entry for MySQL and uncomment the entry for Oracle:

	#database: MySQL
	#database: SQLServer
	database: Oracle

You will also need to comment out the validationQuery in the dataSource properties, and replace it with the one appropriate to Oracle:

	validationQuery: SELECT 1 from DUAL #ORACLE
	#validationQuery: SELECT 1 #Non-Oracle

### Mail Configuration ###
CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard utilizes the Grails `mail` plugin in order to send email messages from time to time, including password reset requests.  CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard must be able to connect to and utilize a valid SMTP server in order to send these email messages.  

Configuration of the mail plugin will be member-specific, and those configuration items will also be added to the `/opt/tomcat/ccpd-config.yml` file, noted above.

#### Default Sender Email Address ####
CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard can be configured with a default "sender" email address, indicating that the application has sent a "forgot password" message, allowing users to enter new logon credentials.  In the `/opt/tomcat/ccpd-config.yml` file (noted above), add the following section:

    ---
    grails:
	    plugin:
	    	springsecurity:
	    		ui:
	    			forgotPassword:
	    				emailFrom: "your-email@member-organization.com"

#### SMTP Configuration ####
Coupled with the default sender email address, CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard's mailing configuration must also include connection to a valid SMTP server, in order to correctly distribute the "forgot password" messages.  Numerous SMTP services exist, such as Gmail, Hotmail, Amazon SES, or in-house SMTP services available through corporate emailing technologies, such as Exchange.  CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard can support these SMTP servers, as long as the connection information is correct in the configuration file (the `/opt/tomcat/ccpd-config.yml` noted above).

By default the plugin assumes an unsecured mail server configured at `localhost` on port `25`. However you can change this via the application configuration file (the `/opt/tomcat/ccpd-config.yml` noted above). 

For example here is how you would configure the default sender to send with a Gmail account:
#### *Mail Configuration - Gmail* ####
    ---
    grails:
	    mail:
		    host: "smtp.gmail.com"
		    port: 465
		    username: "youracount@gmail.com"
		    password: "yourpassword"
		    props:
			    mail.smtp.auth: "true",
			    mail.smtp.socketFactory.port: "465"
			    mail.smtp.socketFactory.class: "javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory"
			    mail.smtp.socketFactory.fallback: "false"

And the configuration for sending via a Hotmail/Live account:
#### *Mail Configuration - Hotmail/Live* ####
    ---
    grails:
	    mail:
		    host: "smtp.live.com"
		    port: 587
		    username: "youracount@live.com"
		    password: "yourpassword"
		    props:
			    mail.smtp.starttls.enable: "true"
			    mail.smtp.port: "587"

And the configuration for sending via a Yahoo account:
#### *Mail Configuration - Yahoo* ####
    ---
    grails:
	    mail:
		    host: "smtp.correo.yahoo.es"
		    port: 465
		    username: "myuser"
		    password: "mypassword"
		    props:
			    mail.smtp.auth: "true"
			    mail.smtp.socketFactory.port: "465"
			    mail.smtp.socketFactory.class: "javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory"
			    mail.smtp.socketFactory.fallback: "false"

**Security Considerations**

We want the ccpd-config.yml to be as secure as possible.  Only the tomcat user needs to be able to read the file.  We recommend limiting permissions to the file by running the following commands:

	> sudo chown tomcat ccpd-config.yml
	> sudo chgrp tomcat ccpd-config.yml
	> sudo chmod 400 ccpd-config.yml

### Deploy WAR (Continued) ###
Connect to the application server and transfer the `CCPD.war` to the `/opt/tomcat/webapps` directory.  If Tomcat is running, it should automatically deploy the application.  If Tomcat is not running, starting it will deploy the application.

Once Tomcat is done with its deployment you should be able to access the application by entering `http://<public url of application server>:8080/CCPD`, into a browser.

You may need to restart tomcat in order to complete the deployment,  you can do so using the following command

	> sudo service tomcat restart

CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard will bootstrap in a user with:

    username: admin, 
    password: @admin123

**Notes**:
Your network must allow traffic on 8080
(If deployed to AWS) Your security group in AWS must allow traffic on 8080

### Web Server ###
The final configuration is for a web server to proxy the Tomcat instance and to answer traffic on port `80/443`.

#### Apache HTTP Server ####
Install Apache 2.4 by running: 
    sudo apt-get install apache2

Create a file named `ccpd.conf` in the following directory: `/etc/apache2/sites-available` with the following lines:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
	    ServerName <public url of application server>
	    ProxyRequests Off
	    <Proxy *>
		    Order deny,allow
		    Allow from all
	    </Proxy>
	    ProxyPreserveHost on
	    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
    </VirtualHost>

The `ServerName` should be the `<public url of application server>`

Execute the following commands to enable the proxy module:

    sudo a2enmod proxy
    sudo a2enmod proxy_ajp
    sudo a2enmod proxy_http
    sudo service apache2 restart

Execute the following commands to enable the reverse proxy to Tomcat:

    sudo a2ensite ccpd.conf
    sudo service apache2 reload

The Apache HTTP server should now be configured to serve requests to CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard.  The application should be available at the URL entered into your `ccpd-config.yml`: `http://<public url http server>/CCPD`

### Securing Web Traffic ###
The steps above will have the CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard application running over normal HTTP on port `80`.  This presents a risk as data, including user credentials, will be transmitted in clear text.  It is recommended that traffic be secured using HTTPS.  The following article explains how to create a self-signed certificate and apply it to a web server in Ubuntu 16.04: [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-apache-in-ubuntu-16-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-apache-in-ubuntu-16-04)

**NOTE:** 
After completing the steps in the article, you will have to change your connector in ccpd.conf to use port 443 instead of port 80.  Also, when you chose a common name in the certificate creation process, the name must match the DNS name portion of the serverURL in ccpd-config.yml.  i.e.  if your serverURL is https://www.example.com/CCPD, then the common name in the certificate must be www.example.com

### Ensuring Trust ###
In the browser's URL bar, navigate to the CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard application.  Click on the HTTPS certificate chain (next to URL address). In the Google Chrome browser, if the user sees a "Not Secure" label next to the URL, the certificate is not trusted.  Click on the "Not Secure" link to display the certificate information:

- Click the "Details" link to display the "Security Overview" information.
- Click on the "View Certificate" button to display the certificate details.

The certificate information needs to be exported, and added to the servers trust store.  On the "details" tab of the certificate information, click the "Copy to File..." button.  The "certificate export wizard" will be displayed.

- Click the "Next" button to navigate to the second screen, the export type selection:

Select the "DER encoded binary X.509 (.CER)" radio button.  This selection should be the default.  Click "Next" to continue.

Select or browse to a location to where the `.cer` file will be saved.  Clicking "Next" and finally "Finish" to complete the wizard and save the file to the selected location/filename.  This file will need to be transferred via SCP, S/FTP to the application server hosting the CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard application.  Note the location to which the file is transferred.  For the purposes of this User's Guide, assume the location of the `ccpd_cert.cer` file is `/home/ubuntu/ccpd_cert.cer`.

#### Importing the certificate into the trust store ####
Once the file has been transferred to the application server, locate the `$JAVA_HOME` file location, i.e. the filesystem location of the java executable being used to launch Tomcat and host CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard.  For the purposes of this User's Guide, assume the location of `$JAVA_HOME` can be found at `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`.  When using Java 8, the required `cacerts` file will be located at `$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts`.  The location of the `cacerts` file should be noted before importing the certificate using `keytool`.

Finally, using the java `keytool` application, import the certificate:

    # Navigate to the $JAVA_HOME folder's bin directory.
    cd /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin
     
    # Execute keytool
    sudo keytool -import alias ccpd -keystore ../lib/security/cacerts -file /home/ubuntu/ccpd_cert.cer
The user should be prompted to enter the keystore credentials.  By default, this credential is `changeit`.

    # The user will be asked for confirmation
    Trust this certificate? [no]:

Answering `yes` to this confirmation prompt will import the certificate into the trust store.

**NOTE**:  If the application server is currently running, it must be restarted in order to incorporate the trust store.

###Set up Import Folders###
In order to import files into the Dashboard, you need to set up the temp folders that it uses for processing.  Login to the system as a user with ROLE_ADMIN, and set the following three settings to directories on the server running the dashboard application:

	legacy.sourceDir = /opt/legacy/source
	legacy.processedDir = /opt/legacy/processed
	legacy.errorDir = /opt/legacy/error
	
You can also set the processedRetention number, which determines how many processed xml files are saved in the process directory after being imported into the Dashboard:

	legacy.processedRetentionNumber = 1000


###Upgrading from a previous version###

To upgrade from an earlier version of CCPD:

1) stop your application server.  if you followed the deployment guide that would be tomcat, and you would stop with:  

	sudo service tomcat stop

2) copy the new CCPD.war into the tomcat/webapps directory.

3) Start the application server:  

	sudo service tomcat start

That will redeploy the new war over the old application.  CCPD has a bootstrap initialization script that will run on its first deployment that will make necessary data changes.

If there are any additional upgrading steps specific to a release version, information about those steps will be included in that versions README.txt


###LDAP/Active Directory Integration (Optional)###
With this integration, LDAP/Active Directory will be used to manage user authentication and permissions within CCPD. 

Users will use their LDAP/AD credentials to log into the application. LDAP/AD roles and user properties such firstname, lastname and email will be imported. If the user doesn't exist in CCPD, he will be created when he logs in, and granted with basic user roles (ROLE_BASIC\_USER and ROLE\_USER) by default, plus additional LDAP Roles.

####LDAP Configuration####
Here is an example of LDAP structure in OpenLDAP:
![](https://i.imgur.com/6nNTW0X.png)

Based on the above structure, add the following section in the `/opt/tomcat/ccpd-config.yml` file (noted above): 
		
	---
	grails:
		plugin:
			springsecurity:
				providerNames: ['ldapAuthProvider','rememberMeAuthenticationProvider','restAuthenticationProvider','anonymousAuthenticationProvider']
				ldap:
					active: true
					context:
						managerDn: 'cn=Manager,dc=cisecurity,dc=org'
						managerPassword: 'my_manager_password'
						server: 'ldap://127.0.0.1:389'

						groupSearchFilter: 'uniquemember={0}'
						groupRoleAttribute: 'cn'        
						clean:
							prefix: 'CCPD_'
					search:
						base: 'dc=cisecurity,dc=org' 
						filter: '(uid={0})'

						passwordAttributeName: 'userPassword'
					mapper:
						passwordAttributeName: 'userPassword'               
					useRememberMe: true  
				rememberMe:
					persistent: true

####Active Directory Configuration####
Here is an example of Active Directory structure in Windows server 2016:
![](https://i.imgur.com/BsKQRuq.png)

Based on the above structure, add the following section in the `/opt/tomcat/ccpd-config.yml` file (noted above): 
		
	---
	grails:

####Configuration options####
Here is a description of some configuration options used for LDAP/AD integration:

- **managerDn/managerPassword:** manager credential to access to LDAP server.

- **server:** URL of the LDAP server.

- **groupSearchBase:** the base directory to start the group search. Note: if  we don't want to retrieve groups (roles) from LDAP, set retrieveGroupRoles to false.

- **groupSearchFilter:** the pattern to be used for the user search. {0} is the userâ€™s DN.

- **groupRoleAttribute:** the ID of the attribute which contains the role name for a group.

- **clean.prefix:** an optional string prefix to strip from the beginning of LDAP group names. For example, 'CCPD\_' will convert CCPD\_ADMIN to ROLE\_ADMIN

- **base:** the base directory to start the search.

- **filter:** the filter expression used in the user search. For LDAP, uid field is typically used as username for the filter. In Active Directory, sAMAccountName (also called "User logon name") is typically used. 

- **passwordAttributeName:** the name of the password attribute to use.

####LDAP/AD requirements####
The email address is a required field, make sure that LDAP/AD user email field is set properly.

If some users were previously created in CCPD before the LDAP integration, make sure the username matches with the one in LDAP (uid) or AD (sAMAccountName, also called "User logon name").  

The api user needs to be created in LDAP/AD in order to generate an authentication token to import Asset Report Format (ARF) results from CIS-CAT Assessor. 

Once LDAP/AD authentication is integrated to CCPD, the database authentication will be automatically disabled.
